`Important! For tests to run successfully, applying patches from patches/ directory is needed (to caravel and mgmt_soc)`

Testbenches description

### boot_cw

Boots cpu with emulation of external `CW` bus.

Submits a few prepareed instructions including jumps and memory accesses.
Test verifies if correct bus requests are made according to expected program flow.

Besides verifying general instruction execturion, it also checks cache behaviour (line-fetching on first access, cache hit on near address).
Memory loads from cache are verified by comparing interal CPU register state. 

### boot_embed

Starts CPU as disabled and in `embed` mode.

Writes `test.s` program on internal ram via internal SPI interface.

Test program sets up memory paging for device access and then reads and writes to GPIO pins.

Additionaly interrupt support is tested with handler that modifes GPIO and restores control back to main loop.

Program flow is verifed by monitoring all GPIO state changes and comparing to expected result.

## Dependencies

- Docker: [Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux&utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=header) ||  [Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=header) || [Mac with Intel Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=header) || [Mac with Apple Chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=header)

## Running the simulation

Assuming you already:
- went throught the [quick start](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/main/docs/source/quickstart.rst) for setting up your environemnt,
- integrated your design into the user's wrapper and
- hardenned your design as well as the user's wrapper (for GL simulation)

````
make simenv
SIM=RTL make verify-<dv-test>
# OR
SIM=GL make verify-<dv-test>
````
``<dv-test>``: io_ports, mprj_stimulus, la_test1, la_test2 or wb_port.  

# For advanced users

## Simulation Environment Setup

There are two options for setting up the simulation environment: 

* Pulling a pre-built docker image 
* Installing the dependecies locally. Instructions to setting up the environment locally can be found [here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/verilog/dv/local-install.md)

### Docker

There is an available docker setup with the needed tools at [efabless/dockerized-verification-setup](https://github.com/efabless/dockerized-verification-setup) 

Run the following to pull the image: 

```
docker pull efabless/dv_setup:latest
```

## Running Simulation

First, you will need to export a number of environment variables: 

```bash
export PDK_PATH=<pdk-location/sky130A>
export CARAVEL_ROOT=<caravel_root>
export TARGET_PATH=<caravel_user_project>
```

Then, run the following command to start the docker container :

```
docker run -it -v ${TARGET_PATH}:${TARGET_PATH} -v ${PDK_ROOT}:${PDK_ROOT} \
		-v ${CARAVEL_ROOT}:${CARAVEL_ROOT} \
		-e TARGET_PATH=${TARGET_PATH} -e PDK_ROOT=${PDK_ROOT} \
		-e CARAVEL_ROOT=${CARAVEL_ROOT} \
		-e TOOLS=/foss/tools/riscv-gnu-toolchain-rv32i/411d134 \
		-e DESIGNS=$(TARGET_PATH) \
		-e CORE_VERILOG_PATH=$(TARGET_PATH)/mgmt_core_wrapper/verilog \
		-e MCW_ROOT=$(MCW_ROOT) \
		efabless/dv_setup:latest
```

Then, navigate to the directory where the DV tests reside : 

```bash
cd $TARGET_PATH/verilog/dv/
```

To run any simulation, you need to be on the top level or caravel_user_project.

To run RTL simulation for one of the DV tests, 

```bash
SIM=RTL make verify-<dv-test>
```

To run gate level simulation for one of the DV tests, 

```bash
SIM=GL make verify-<dv-test>
```
